<h1>Rubinius Compute - Programming for the Internet</h1>

<p><a href="http://compute.rubinius.com"><strong>Rubinius Compute</strong></a> is a platform for computation inspired by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a> that builds on the Rubinius language platform.</p>

<p>We see two major trends converging: First, more devices are being connected and those devices need to communicate, driving a constant rise in network use. Second, more data is being created, processed, and stored.</p>

<p>The problem is, there's a massive asymmetry in the network. A relatively tiny number of "smart" nodes do all the work and receive most of the communication, while an enormous number of nodes mostly just add load to the network.</p>

<h1>Who's Using Ruby (or Not), for What, and Why?</h1>

<p>The way we build, test, deploy, maintain, and support applications has changed a lot in the past five years. Containers, microservices, the growing number of connected devices (IoT, if you must), and the sorts of applications people are building with <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> are big, not small, changes.</p>

<p>How does Ruby and Rails fit into this rapidly changing landscape? If you search Google for <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=what%20companies%20use%20Ruby%20or%20Rails">"what companies use Ruby or Rails"</a> there's not a lot of specific details about <em>what</em> people are doing with Rails. How does Rails fit into a containerized microservices environment? How are people building services with Rails, or are they? I'm curious about this and I think a lot of the new developers learning Ruby in this changing environment would be as well.</p>

<p>So, I've put together a really brief survey; I'd love to hear more about why people are using Ruby, or why they are not.</p>

<p>Survey: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cf8OstwXmI">Who's Using Ruby (or Not), for What, and Why?</a></p>

<h1>Rubinius Analyst - Know Your App</h1>

<p><a href="http://analyst.rubinius.com"><strong>Rubinius Analyst</strong></a> is the first product from <a href="/2015/10/27/rubinius-inc-a-benefit-company/">Rubinius, Inc</a>, building on the technology in the Rubinius language platform.</p>

<p><a href="http://analyst.rubinius.com"><strong>Analyst</strong></a> is a tool for anyone who has struggled to understand, evolve, transform, and scale an application.</p>

<p>It is an alternative to paying the significant cost to rewrite an application that has grown too large and complex to confidently update as quickly as business innovation now requires.</p>

<p>During the past 5-10 years, the world of programming has changed significantly. Languages like Clojure, Go, Rust, and Scala are commanding ever greater mind-share, and JavaScript has pushed into new territory, both within the browser and outside it. Programmers are not just switching languages, they are also changing the way they build applications.</p>

<h1>Rubinius, Inc - A Benefit Company</h1>

<p>I'm excited to share with you that I've formed <strong>Rubinius, Inc</strong>, an Oregon corporation designated as a "benefit company", to focus on building excellent programming language tools and sustain the development of the Rubinius platform.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, <a href="http://benefitcorp.net">What is a benefit company?</a></p>

<p>Generally, it is a statutory designation that allows the business to consider the general social benefit and the environment when making decisions, rather than only focusing on revenue impact. The designation does not affect the tax structure for the business, and typically requires the business to publish an annual transparency report about the company's impact on society and the environment.</p>

<p>I elected to form a benefit company, rather than a foundation or non-profit, because I believe it provides the lowest administrative overhead while building a sustainable economic model to support Rubinius as an open source project. A portion of the shares of Rubinius, Inc are dedicated solely to sustaining Rubinius.</p>

<h1>Rubinius 3.0: The Third Epoch</h1>

<p>A little more than a year ago, I published a series of posts about the focus for Rubinius 3.0 (<a href="/2014/11/10/rubinius-3-0-part-1-the-rubinius-team/">part 1</a>, <a href="/2014/11/11/rubinius-3-0-part-2-the-process/">part 2</a>, <a href="/2014/11/12/rubinius-3-0-part-3-the-instructions/">part 3</a>, <a href="/2014/11/13/rubinius-3-0-part-4-the-system-and-tools/">part 4</a>, <a href="/2014/11/14/rubinius-3-0-part-5-the-language/">part 5</a>). We spent a lot of time last year on some architecture improvements, so now it's time to get busy on those 3.0 goals. This post will catch you up to date.</p>

<h2>What's In A Version Number</h2>

<p>I wrote two posts recently on the Rubinius <a href="/2015/09/22/major-minor-maximize-delivering-features-minimize-trouble/">versioning scheme</a> and <a href="/2015/09/23/distributed-coding-distributed-releases/">release process</a>. Review those posts for details, but I'll summarize the main ideas here.</p>

<p>First, Rubinius uses a versioning scheme that associates a "version number", in the form of EPOCH.SEQ, with a particular git commit SHA via a git tag. The first part of the version number, the EPOCH, signifies "a period of time marked by notable events or particular characteristics" (see the dictionary definition). This post explains the Rubinius 3.x epoch.</p>

<p>The SEQ is a monotonically increasing number that has no other meaning than to signal that newer code is available. The Rubinius versioning scheme is emphatically <em>not</em> <a href="http://semver.org">SemVer</a>.</p>

<h1 id="platform">Rubinius Language Platform</h1>

<p>Rubinius is a platform for building programming language technology.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine human society without the presence of language. Every advance in human history results from processing and sharing information. The digital revolution is merely the latest of many such advances. <em>Languages are the preeminent tool for processing information.</em> Through the use of languages, humans do the work of information processing and transform the world around them. Humans discovered fire; they invented rocket engines.</p>

<p>Computers are the engines for information processing. Extremely powerful computers are everywhere now. Hundreds of millions of people use them every day. But a tiny fraction of those people actually use the computer itself. A computer is the most powerful machine humans have created and yet most people only use the computer through an app someone else made. The next leap forward for society requires widespread ability to use computers directly.</p>

<p>Rubinius is not the only project focused on making computers better for more people. Most projects aim to make computers easier to use in some respect. Rubinius is instead focused on <em>making people more able to use computers</em>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Want-Your-Customers-Become-ebook/dp/B008HRM9X4/">Technology is transformative.</a> Henry Ford didn't just manufacture cars, he helped create a nation of drivers. Rubinius envisions a world where people use computers to solve problems, building their own roads in a sense, not merely following the roads someone else built for them.</p>

<p><strong>Stacy Mullins</strong>: At one point, Stacy would have gladly chosen a typewriter over a computer. But at school for graphic design, she became fascinated by technologies like HTML and CSS and the ability to create something from scratch. Now she's learning about crafting code and communicating well with other developers.</p>

<p><strong>Yorick Peterse</strong>: When not breaking code, Yorick is fixing it and asking questions. Either way, there is a lot of code happening. He's drawn to the deep technical details of systems like just-in-time compilers and concurrency. He may or may not be a Dr. Evil character hatching plans for world domination.</p>
